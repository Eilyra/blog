They say time flies when you're having fun and the last few weeks have gone by rather quickly. As [mentioned briefly, Argus is down.]({{<relref "post/2018/terraria.md">}}) Now this is a few weeks ago and I have my kill by now as well along with my trial being over in the guild apparently. That was a bit of a surprise, since I just kind of ended up being promoted without any feedback or discussion or the like but nice nonetheless.

The Argus fight in itself was fairly trivial at this point though I did do a few silly mistakes. There's only really one difficult part in the last phase if one gets the wrong debuff, aside from that it seems to be basically: stay with the group unless you have bomb/debuff in which case out of the group. Sure there is a bit more nuance than that and Argus isn't an easy boss, but it still felt fairly straightforward---which gives me much better understanding for some of the people in the guild who are kind of done with the boss since I'm guessing they were rather tired of wiping on other people's mistakes. Though that is something that happens with every difficult boss and we actually managed the kill with relatively few wipes, 225 or so.

Now I'm just curious to see how they continue with the setups, since I believe only three healers need anything from Argus if they decide to keep taking four healers along or go with three from now on for farm as well.

When it comes to downing bosses, there has obviously been some other "progress" for me as well since the last boss I mentioned [progressing on was Kin'garoth]({{<relref "post/2018/kingaroth-und-mehr.md">}}). So far the Coven of Shivarra still stands for me, but Kin'garoth, Varimathras and Aggramar have been downed---along with Argus as mentioned. The Kin'garoth fight was about as [straightforward as it felt in progress]({{<relref "post/2018/kingaroth.md">}}), it's still error prone with the bombs but other than that straightforward.

Varimathras is almost the same as heroic, just that one has an escort when one goes out with the Necrotic Embrace and there's a need for keeping proper distances due to this. Also there's an add that needs to be focused quickly. The fight remains a pure mechanics check, similar to the Maiden in Tomb of Sargeras.

Aggramar, well, just felt like more damage. Sure the big cleave needs to be soaked as two camps as it applies a debuff increasing the damage taken from it, and there spawn some more adds. But the intermissions remain the only difficult phase healerwise and beyond that it's just add control. Which is fragile yes, and takes time to learn but doesn't apply to me as a healer much. Though I did get to help a bit with kicking the adds back, which was fun.

Aside from raids, I have also gotten into doing some mythic+ a bit more regularily again which has been really nice. It feels good to be pushing for higher keys again and being challenged---though this week hasn't gone quite according to plan with more depletions than I'd have thought. But no matter, it has been too much fun anyway to care too much about that. I think I'm slowly managing to get rid of the [stress to perform]({{<relref "post/2018/voll-am-raiden.md">}}) I have been feeling at times which has prevented me from enjoying aspects of the game I tend to enjoy the most.

With that said, I'm actually hoping I manage to play the key I have still, though time is quickly running out and finding decent people for a key this late might be a challenge. But should still be manageable, if not then not the end of the world either.

Overall, good times at the moment. I'm really looking forward to actually participating in progress when Battle for Azeroth comes out, hopefully there will be many opportunities for that.

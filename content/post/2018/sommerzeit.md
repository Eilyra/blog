So last weekend we---along with most of Europe I believe---changed to summer time. Now while this is a change that would seem minor for me since I don't have that many things in my life that are dependant on being somewhere at a specific time, it still has somehow managed to make me feel a bit more tired than before and caused me to sleep longer as a consequence---which feels slightly ironic, since I believe one of the purported benefits of summer time is that one has more daylight hours available. Anyway, I'm sure I'll end up adapting soon enough, though the transition period is always annoying.

There is an [ongoing effort to abolish summer time in the European Union](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finland_to_lobby_eu_for_abolition_of_daylight_saving_time/10042340) which would be nice, but I think it will be a while until that goes through if at all. From what I remember the reception has been rather lukewarm so far, with no one opposing the change but not really giving it any direct support either which I find rather disappointing. Hopefully something ends up coming out of it before next year, so we don't have to suffer through the change too many more times but knowing politics it'll probably take longer than that.

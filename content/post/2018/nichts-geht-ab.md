Sometimes there are quiet times, like the past week. Not much has really been going on apart from the usual raids and some mythic+. And while that has been slightly disappointing at times---mostly because I keep wanting to do more mythic+ and do better there---it's actually gone as one should have expected. The affixes aren't exactly conducive to doing higher keys, especially within the constraints of our setup since we don't really have any classes that excel at dealing with orbs.

In good news however, some of the disappointment has also come from increased interest and consequently participation of a few guildies in the runs. They have indicated a more regular interest in doing higher keys, which would allow for a team that plays better together instead of the constant reliance on random people that are hard to evaluate before the run begins. Now I did mention disappointment, and that has partially come from some level of inexperience showed by them at times, but inexperience is quite simply fixed by experience so that will come with time. Setup wise, I actually think we should be decently off for most affixes even if it is very unconventional. Though Hyrja might pose some problems, but when doesn't she?

This is actually making me a bit more excited for the coming weeks---well, not the next, the affixes are even worse and I don't think there will be any higher keys done then---since we get to refine the team and I actually get to know some more people from the guild better.

Quiet times however, are also perfect for taking a poke at some other games and me and a guildie did that yesterday with Magicka. I have played the game through before, but it remains really fun even though it was a particularily deadly time yesterday for some reason---as in, I kept dying. There did seem to be a surprising amount of lag at times, as in enemies walking through my mines and the mines just despawning without doing damage which might have contributed to some of my deaths---though luckily in coop you have a resurrection spell that is rather easy to cast.

The game really is meant for the chaos of multiplayer and not the slow methodical play of single player. Maybe I'll end up doing a similar retrospective on Magicka as I did on [Terraria]({{<relref "post/2018/terraria.md">}}), though I feel Magicka requires less explaining than Terraria---the fun is a bit more obvious: crazy, destructive magical coop. Fair warning though, it's really important who one plays with. If one likes constantly goofing around and killing their teammates and that frustrates the other player, it probably won't be a fun experience.

It is really fun in single player as well, though the game is *much* harder when played alone for two reasons:

1. In single player, you are the target of all enemy abilities making you that much more likely to die
2. As mentioned, in multiplayer other players can ressurect you. In single player, you have a spirit that will ressurect you once between save points, otherwise you get sent back to the save point.

In single player you do avoid your coop partners accidentally killing you though, which does make it slightly easier to stay alive but is in no way a compensation for the benefits having other players there brings. The two modes quite simply require very different playstyles, single player more focused on shields and walls and in multiplayer one can have a bit more fun as well as more time to cast things.

All in all, I was already about to ask if we could continue playing, but the guildie isn't online yet so I guess that will have to wait a bit... Well, good things are worth waiting for. And there seem to be many good things to wait for, there was a [Q&A announced](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/21617652/join-us-for-a-live-developer-q-a-thursday-3-15) for Thursday, Magicka as noted, hopefully more successful mythic+ with a more regular group of cool people---from what I can tell my guildies are pretty cool---and finally Battle for Azeroth a bit further into the future. No confirmed release date yet, wonder if we get one on Thursday? Would seem a bit early but one never knows.

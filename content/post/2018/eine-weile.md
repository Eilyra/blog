Somehow, it has been a while since I've decided to write something which feels slightly strange. It is partially due to not much happening I think, mythic+ was really quiet last week for some reason with barely any runs going on. We did take a poke at a Lower Karazhan +26 but unfortunately decided not to even finish it much less do it in time. That was also Tuesday evening so we did not get a chance to go on and try the +25 at a later date which I find slightly unfortunate---though it would've proved rather difficult with Moroes and grievous which is an especially painful combination even without tyrannical.

What has been happening, strangely enough, is some more leveling. I actually have two character's I've been leveling a bit, namely a Highmountain Shaman and a Nightborne Warlock---mostly just so I have the appearances unlocked in case I want to play one of those races.<!--more-->

It has been going decently, getting to Karazhan again was really nice since that's just such an amazing spurt though it does make normal leveling thereafter that much more difficult. I honestly don't know how I feel about the classes yet---I probably won't play the warlock much after leveling because I tend to not like playing as a damage dealer and that is the only choice as warlock but for leveling alone Affliction has been rather nice so far and it goes at a decent pace but then I'm only in Classic zones at the moment which are rather a lot easier than the later zones.

The shaman, on the other hand, feels really slow at the moment both as restoration and elemental. It just feels like the casts take forever and they don't feel overly impactful. This might be a case of poor gear which is understandable while leveling especially since we've used some more unusual methods that don't provide much relevant gear. But we're about to start with Legion zones---specifically the invasions---which should provide a rather nice boost of experience and hopefully a bit of gear as well.

Speaking of unusual methods, we did some more experimenting this time around specifically going into Firelands and trying some of the trash there. It wasn't something I would recommend since the packs there didn't give overly much experience and were actually rather hard to kill even though we went in there more overleveled than Karazhan---72-73 into Karazhan, 90-91 into Firelands. Though the turtles there did give a rather big chunk of experience, almost 3000 each and they were also much easier to kill than the other packs. Unfortunately, there aren't overly many of them so the instance limit will be the biggest blocker along with how much one will need to move. But Tol'vir is around those levels anyway and much more lucrative so I would suggest going there until 91 or so and after that just doing treasures and bonus objectives in Draenor---that seems to be the quickest route.

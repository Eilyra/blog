Blizzard added something really cool for tailors in Battle for Azeroth: [Resilient Spellthread](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279182/resilient-spellthread). It prevents you from being dazed in Kul Tiras and Zandalar, which is a really nice perk to have before flying is active and while outdoor content like world quests and herb farming are the most relevant.<!--more-->

Unfortunately, Resilient Spellthread hasn't worked for the whole expansion and recently got a silent nerf to the description[^1] stating it only works while walking and running, not mounted which would be the most useful part.

This change has understandably left [many tailors somewhat miffed](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20767688790?page=1) with me among them. Now, tailoring has for a long time been a profession with little long-term usefulness though an expansion like most professions where you primarily craft gear but this just leaves one feeling robbed of something that was clearly inteded to be there and it just kind of seems they couldn't be bothered fixing.

Now that is possibly unecessarily harsh language; I recongize that software development must have priorities of what gets fixed and in the grand scheme of things one broken utility effect for a profession that the majority of players probably does not have isn't high on the list. Or maybe it was always inteded to only work while on foot. That does not change the feeling this change leaves behind.

Now there are two other utility spellthreads for tailors, one that decreases threat and another one that decreases falling damage and I am running around with the reduced falling damage for now to at least get some utility out of the profession. However, being immune to daze really was one of the cool things I was looking forward to with tailoring in Battle for Azeroth, and now with that gone and the rarity of Anchor Weed and [the despawning nodes which are becoming a meme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9c4r3b/why_is_anchor_weed_like_this/) I am seriously considering switching professions. I have mixed feelings about this since I've had the profession for so long but looking at it logically the doubled flask duration of alchemy is the only profession perk that makes any sense at the moment.[^2]

It's really unfortunate that the other spellthreads feel so lacklustre since we as tailors haven't really had anything new and useful to craft since the [Frostweave Net](https://www.wowhead.com/item=41509/frostweave-net) in Wrath of the Lich King. Now I have been using those rather actively since the extra 3 second root is a nice thing to have, but the tiny amount of utility it brings just does not feel worth the price of keeping the profession around for me.

Now, before someone argues "but you can craft gear!", that is really low on utility for two reasons. Firstly, it is rather slow with the materials for that gear being timegated by dungeon and later raid lockouts. Secondly, once the raid releases on Wednesday, that gear is completely irrelevant since the raid will drop as good---or better once mythic releases---gear anyway. It might bring some small utility to players who are focusing on the easier tiers of raiding or not raiding at all, but with titanforging I'm not even sure that applies. I'm also ignoring the item level 300 gear since that can be bought and is so low item level anyway as to be completely useless.

In the end, I think I'll watch out for hotfixes until Tuesday or so hoping this gets fixed, and if not I'll start leveling alchemy so I have that skilled enough to get the extra hour on flasks before the raid on Wednesday. Might need to do some extra herb farming, so probably good to get at least a days head start on that.

[^1]: This change is only live in the English client from what I know, at least the German client still clearly states "while riding or running/walking".
[^2]: Engineering does have some fun toys as well, admittedly, but those are rather more niche than the constant gold savings of an extra hour on the flask.

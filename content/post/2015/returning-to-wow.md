So, I ended up playing World of Warcraft again after taking a break (again) about a month or two into the current expansion (Warlords of Draenor). I had decided to take the break because I didn't have anything to do that interested me at the time and ended up returning because I got the inspiration to start leveling some more classes to see if I could find something that I could see myself playing a bit more.

The first (and only so far) class I've started leveling up so far is a mage and it's been quite fun so far. I've ended up getting to level 92, however with the leveling motivation & speed slowing significantly since hitting Warlord's content. I find this quite interesting, as before I had rated Warlord's as probably the best leveling experience so far, being so focused on story. This may however be its downfall, as I've already played two characters through the story, doing so another time with the very rigid quest layout isn't overly motivating at this time.

Still, I would like to get the mage to 100 before I decied what class to level next, though I'm having some difficulty deciding what that class should be. I have some interest in leveling another pure DPS class, probably a warlock, however I'm already struggling to handle the instance queue times on the mage when I do decide to do them, so I don't think I could handle it again. I might end up leveling another tank, though that runs into the problem of difficulties with getting back into raiding which is my main interest with the game, despite my current obsession with leveling.

The final option would be to level another healer, which is where I'm leaning currently, though I'm having a hard time choosing which class. I've grown somewhat disillusioned with my current main, a Holy priest, primarily because the healing style has changed so much from the one I enjoyed. I might just end up trying Disc, though having been a Holy player for so long & it being what made my truly enjoy the game back in the day, I'm having a somewhat hard time "betraying" "my" spec. The other alternatives are probably either a shaman or a monk, both with some drawbacks however (can't be a Night Elf shaman, not sure I like the extra resource in Chi with the monk).

Still though with the healers, I'm not sure how well I would like the modern very spammy feeling healing style, though that was certainly applicable to the classes I'm considering at the time I most enjoyed priest healing (though admittedly monks didn't exist yet). So all in all, I'm still in search for what would be my current best fit within the game, if there even is one that's good enough for me to continue playing once I start reaching raiding again. Though then the challenge of finding a guild I would like to raid with begins, which might prove somewhat difficult.

Things have been rather slow lately. After BRF, I haven't really participated in raids which is a tad unfortunate. This is partially because as far as I can tell, there haven't really been further raids organised in the guild or they've been unfortunately too late for my schedule.

However, I've not been completely idle, there has been some running of LFR which has lead to somewhat upgraded rings on both the priest & druid (still the 690 variant though). And that brings me nicely to this: I've been playing my priest again somewhat and it's been quite nice. In the end, priest is probably the class I do enjoy the most, even if I don't think the changes along the years have been all that kind. It's been nice bringing some "old-style" healing into the LFR's I participate in, though my insistence not to waste mana usually doesn't translate overly well to the meters (unless one decides to look at overhealing). It is quite silly though how many healers LFR requires, considering at least at this point at least one if not two are probably doing pretty much nothing, at least in the "older" raids. I've not into HFC that much, at least the LFR variant of it seems the least interesting of the currently available raids. I'm sure it's a much better experience on a proper difficulty level.

Besides that, I've been poking a bit at leveling a warrior, though that's still early stages and not going overly quickly. I should probably just respec Protection and run dungeons, would probably keep me more interested. Though I do generally find I don't overly enjoy tanking at the level-cap and DPS is right out, so I'm not quite sure where I'm going with the warrior leveling.

Outside of the game though, I've been following Kugnen's Project Sixty with some interest. It seems like a valiant effort in recreating a somewhat sped up Vanilla Progression and seems somewhat successful in that effort. From what I've seen through his streams, it does look like a good time. I'd rather play on one of the larger private server's though, if one was looking for an authentic experience. That of course isn't available in this case, as Kungen can't really go on a private server while being a partnered streamer, so.

Besides that though, WoW wise, it's been very quiet for me. I'm not overly enthusiastic about attempting to join a guild at the moment as I've other commitments and without one there isn't all that much in the game that I can currently do that would be of interest. I did take a very half-hearted stab at getting Draenor flying, however the dailies involved in order to acquire the reputation required just felt very uninteresting and that stopped that plan.

What we currently know of Legion however, especially the Holy Priest changes, do look rather good. Hopefully I'll have a better opportunity at that time to participate in raiding! Until then though, I might end up freezing my sub (again), we'll see what the rest of the year brings.

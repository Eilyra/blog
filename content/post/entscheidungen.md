I posted about [me looking for a guild a while back]({{< relref "post/2017-11-23-gildensuche.md" >}}), and while I *technically* found a guild it did not quite meet the goals I had set out when looking for a guild with regards to the level of progress. Now, we've been at it for a few resets and the progress is somewhere between expected and slightly disappointing (I had been hoping we'd manage to kill Imonar today for example, sadly wasn't even close. Though there was definite progress). Which all would speak for sending out more applications.

At the same time, I've taken something of a liking to the guild I'm in. That combined with most actually interesting prospects requiring a realm and faction change which comes at a somewhat big cost, makes me reconsider.

Then again, I'm not really in the position to do much mythic+ in this guild, as there aren't many people of the required skill level (it seems at least) to get a group together. Or maybe the interest just isn't there, but most of the keys I see in the top list for the week are not quite high enough. There are a couple of exeptions, but not enough or not of the correct classes.

This all puts me in a somewhat awkward position where I don't quite know what to do and in a sense time is running out. Since not doing anything will lead me to just staying in the guild, as the prospects will dry up with time. New opportunities will come I'm sure, maybe something promising might be showing up tomorrow even as I'm hopefully joining a friend of mine for a quick heroic run. Now just staying because of not being able to decide probably isn't a bad thing either, I do like the guild (or the people in it rather). The worry is more how that will affect my motivation long term, if the progress keeps being not quite what I hoped combined with a lack of mythic+. Might very well lead to boredom which would be rather unfortunate.

Time will tell, maybe I'll just add a few people on Battle.net and chat a bit, go from there.

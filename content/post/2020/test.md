Testing, testing. Now I just want to see if hotkeys work the way I would hope.

Seems that no, they do not. That is rather unfortunate, because it means using this for editing would be very frustrating. Well, not just editing, but authoring as well, which unfortunately does lead me to the conclusion that switching might not be a good idea despite all the potential (speed, security) benefits it might bring. I mean, writing is as nice as it is in Wordpress, enter creates a new paragraph as is to be expected. Quotes:

> Well, they work like basic Markdown quotes so I'd have to figure out something for the citation part of it.

Also, wow, I'm making so many more typos than usual now, what is going on?

## Heading, easy peasy

It is a bit silly that I need to choose what type of heading I want though, but no real biggie. Just defaulting to h2 would be nice, but I guess they need to accomodate other backends and static site generators as well, along with other templates so makes sense.

It is missing the word/paragraph count, but that's not *overly* necessary I find. Oh, [how do links work?](https://example.com) Ok, pretty much as espected, the UI for them is a bit boring though and of course no search for internal linking is a bit of a bummer. Hmm, not that I'm likely to need them considering the type of content I've written so far, but how do code blocks look? I'm curious because someone mentioned having trouble with them on the community site.

```lua
local welp = "Kind of what I expected"
print(welp)
```

I think the real question is how they get formatted on the Markdown side and then parsed by Hugo in my case. Oh, that was something I was considering, using something else than Hugo. Also, I wonder if there is a way to automatically populate the Author field? Seems a bit unecessary to work on the honor system, even if I am the only person using this system. Though to be fair, it does make guest posts easier... I guess that's something that is easily enough customisable?

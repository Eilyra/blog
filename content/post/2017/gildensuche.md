title: Looking for a guild

So the last week or so has been rather annoying as I ended up leaving the guild I was in and have been looking for a new one. Sadly, the search has gone rather terribly so far, though I have a few leads still. I'm really hoping one of those pans out, as it would be rather sad to miss out on the early progress in Antorus since that's usually the most fun time. Unfortunately that's looking rather likely, since the pool of guilds that are of interest is rapidly shrinking.

And I have no idea what I'll end up doing if I don't find a guild, I still want to keep playing the game but if I'm not able to raid at a reasonable level that doesn't really make much sense any more. But time will tell.

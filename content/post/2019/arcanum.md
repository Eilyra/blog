I have been playing one of my favourite games again recently, Arcanum. It's a CRPG released 2001 that unlike many popular ones released around that time is not based on the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset[^dnd]. I think this is what gives me so fond memories of the game, since while I do enjoy Dungeons & Dragons and think it's a good ruleset for Pen & Paper it always felt somewhat lacking while playing it as a CRPG. Especially the whole "casts per day" mechanic I felt really did not fit in with CRPG's that tend to be somewhat monster filled. It made casters really frustrating to play especially at low levels since you either did very little or ended up resting every couple fights. But this was about Arcanum, not Dungeons & Dragons. 

Playing the game has been a somewhat strange experience, since I have really fond memories of playing it a ton as a kid and those memories seem to be very strong since I can still memeber the early levels really well and know almost exactly what I need to do, what quests are available where and how to complete them as well as how I want to level my character even though it has been several years since I last played the game---though I'm not quite sure how long exactly, I think I did another playthrough of the game ten years ago or so?

Still, I find the game excellent but this strange feeling of knowing exactly how everything will play out all the time is keeping me from playing the game a bit. I mean, I still enjoy what I am doing but it feels somewhat routine which is strange since it has been so long since last. The feeling will also probably dissipate a bit the further in I get since I actually haven't played the *whole* game through that many times, only the early levels and maybe the first half or so?

I think I'm actually so slowly at my usuall stopping point back in the day, before going and visiting the Black Mountain Clan. For some reason this first proper dungeon used to intimidate me, I believe partially due to the Rock Golems there which can actually make your weapon break when you attack them.[^durability] Since I'm playing a melee character again this will be something I have to take into account before going in there---perhaps I should get some "expendable" weapon I can use to kill the golems? It's actually really unfortunate, just got nice magical weapons for the whole party after clearing out P. Schuyler and Sons but I guess I need to use the other weapons for only one or two fights in there.

I think I'll start enjoying the game even more once I get over that hurdle, and now with [Uu'nat down]({{< relref "post/2019/tds.md" >}}) we should probably be raiding less again which means I have more time for other games. Though maybe I'll just spend that time [boosting more instead]({{< relref "post/2019/boost-und-foost.md">}}).

With that all said, the game is still one of my all-time favourite CRPGs and if you haven't already played it and like CRPGs I would definitely recommend you do so. But do read the manual, some of the things---like skills training---really aren't explained at all in game. As a kid I had no idea what it did, just that you could pay a trainer to get some text to stand next to the name of the skill. But the training is actually really good, and among other things is what is required in order to be able to try to repair completely broken equipment.

[^dnd]: Some popular examples would include Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale.
[^durability]: If the durability of equipment goes to 0, it is actually permanently broken unless you have skilled repair---NPC blacksmiths can't normally repair completely broken equipment.

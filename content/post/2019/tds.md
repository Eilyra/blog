So the new raid has been out for a while new and we've been poking at it for almost all of our raid time since it came out with the exception of one half-clear of Dazar'alor. So far we have managed to kill the first of two bosses and happily actually killed the boss before significant nerfs. Unfortunately [those nerfs](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/22933417/hotfixes-14-mai-2019) also came to the second boss so won't be able to say the same thing there. Still, the nerfs seem quite justified considering the silly setups we've seen for some of those early kills.

Still it has been really nice to have a new raid to progress and the bosses are also quite fun on mythic if rather boring and undertuned on heroic which rather surprised me. We actually had a decent amount of wipes on the first boss on heroic due to casts going through at the wrong time but ended up killing the second boss on our first try as if almost all of the mechanics were simply irrelevant---it was a really strange feeling.

On mythic however, it's the other way around really. The first boss is deceptively simple: play the kicks and dispels correctly and that's most of what you have to do in order to kill the boss. After that, it mostly comes down to correct timing of cooldowns for the healers and no individual failing too much. Getting all of this clean still took a fair amount of tries for us but once you learn the important parts and don't stress too much amount the irrelevant bits the boss is rather straightforward to play. I did really like the boss though as it managed to give me several mechanics as a healer that were relevant which is somewhat rare.

The second boss on the other hand seems to have more things that are relevant for the whole raid. You have concerns about correct positioning both for baiting the Void Tears as well as not exploding each other wenn you get the marks and making it in time to your relic. In addition you more phase dependant effects you need to look out for in your positioning.

Uu'nat also has a decent amount of somewhat bursty incoming damage that you need to plan for as a healer, which makes the fight more enjoyable for me though cooldown usage being at times boss health dependent does make timing those cooldowns harder. The boss is fun so far though, even if we are only not so consistently poking at phase two. I'm interested to see how it feels to play phase three.

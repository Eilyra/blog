It does also mean that if I were to succeed in changing over to Linux at some point in the future, I would still end up bringing that baggage with me (though I <em>believe</em> there is as of yet no Linux-version of the browser available, so that would be a pain-point as well).</p>\n' +

Her latest iteration is, as mentioned <a href="/2020/01/27/vulpera/">here before, vulpera</a> and while the race does feel quite nice to play and having the roll back is really cool, I still find myself somehow missing both being a blood elf but even more being a night elf.

  there as holy isn&#8217;t such a terrible idea, especially one of the boostraids since the spec might even be slightly better suited for that environment; more easily allowing for healing such large groups.

With a CMS like WordPress in contrast, if I wanted to experiment with the design I had to set up a staging version of the site in order to do that; this problem is solved now though there is still some funkiness going on with how my staging and live environment are linked occasionally causing problems when testing things out.</p>\n' +

It&#8217;s based off of an <a href="/2019/05/30/redesign/">old fansite kit</a> provided by Blizzard, just updated a bit and brought up to a bit more modern standards with responsive elements added so that it works decently on mobile devices as well. There are some parts of it that I&#8217;m not quite sure about still, like the seemingly somewhat low contrast on the article pages themselves as well as some of the link colours, but overall it has served me well in the past year or so. So maybe working with design wouldn&#8217;t be that hopeless of a proposition after all, especially since it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be implementing someone else&#8217;s vision but creating my own of how to use something.</p>\n' +

  have in the past at least as far as the web is concerned. Simultaneously, there is also a lot of pretty designs going on that have poor usability and it always makes me want to improve those things and make them nicer to use; it&#8217;s also one of the main problems I tend to have when dabbling in other MMOs outside of World of Warcraft, the UI gets in the way. Honestly, one of the things I like the most about WoW, is being able to customise the UI so freely and bring the information that is important <em>to me</em> to the fore while blending the rest out. This also always makes it so difficult for me to understand when people hate on addons in WoW and think they are somehow cheating, all they are doing is displaying the information provided by the game in a more sensible manner&#8212;well, most of the time, and when that isn&#8217;t the case steps are generally taken to remedy that. It just seems silly to hate on a feature that is there to make the game better for the players.</p>\n' +

Looking back at some of the things I have written before&#8212;like my writings about bosses we have killed or the like&#8212;I feel a certain uncertainty in those pieces, made for the act of making itself rather than with any more lofty goal, writing a guide that isn&#8217;t quite a guide yet not quite a recollection of the events nor a thorough analysis of the fight.

  for the act of making itself.</p>\n' +

It can be quite interesting to go back and read some of those pieces and look at the state of mind I was in at the time, especially now with the advantage of hindsight. I tend to gain a certain amount of resolve from those moments, since especially when looking back at times when things have felt hopeless in the moment those times have passed and have given time for better things. The best example of this, I think, are the posts during 
  my transition from Alliance to Horde; those were somewhat difficult times where I was neither quite satisfied with the game nor my place at the time, yet both of those things ended up turning for the better and I made some cool new friends through the experience.</p>\n' +

I can remember this happening many times, having written about something and having it feel like a weight being lifted from my shoulders. Thinking about it, I think I need to start doing this around more things in my life though this place probably isn&#8217;t the right platform for that, having a somewhat constrained focus at least in my mind but who but I is to decide about what I write here? Maybe that is what I need the most in this time, to realize that my audience is me and not to write in order to appease others but to write to satisfy myself and get the things said that I want to say, not worrying too much about who they are for but me.</p>\n',

But essentially, in phase two, Ra-den applies a debuff that does damage to the tank which scales with their current health at the time the debuff was applied. Knowing not to heal the tank before the debuff gets applied is of course important because of this, but as noted it got called anyway and I wasn&#8217;t focusing on healing the tanks in that phase so how and why it was important didn&#8217;t really register until way after progress was over.</p>\n' +

  really have much of a choice in the matter. With luck those two things will align however I don&#8217;t feel that is 
  overly likely. The optimal case is of course all of the abilities being close enough together that one can actually choose freely and this is more likely for the healers anyway than for damage dealers or tanks, but it is still something I&#8217;m looking at with more worry than excitement at the moment.</p>\n' +

  going on for healers with all the damage coming in though it ends up feeling somewhat finnicky with how precise all the timings one needs to hit are; a mistake a minute or so earlier with a wrongly used cooldown might lead to deaths later on. Still, it does make the whole thing feel a bit more like a precisely executed dance than anything else, which isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing though it can get frustrating when progressing the later parts of the fight with simply how long it takes to get there. Having to maintain a decent level of concentration for 10+ minutes before one even gets to the new and interesting bit can be difficult at times.</p>\n' +

Sure, there is the dance where you dodge a couple of swirlies and yes some people have to disarm the bombs, but overall it felt more like a bit of a lull between all the activity in the other phases while still requiring somewhat precise execution on timing, namely when the mob dies.</p>\n' +

Now I guess we just need to wait for the alpha or beta to start in order to see how Shadowlands is progressing, though I am more pessimistic than optimistic of its prospects at the moment.</p>\n',

  another raid like Dazar&#8217;alor where one gets turned into the other faction, since Mechagnomes are the Alliance counterpart and while I do find the concept cool, they just aren&#8217;t my jam at all. Though the race changes in Dazar&#8217;alor were somewhat random anyway, not following the counterpart rules of the Orb of Deception at all&#8212;played Forsaken, got turned into Human instead of a Night Elf for some reason.</p>\n',

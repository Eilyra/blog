          <article class="post-content">So I haven&rsquo;t written much about recent raiding efforts and lots has happened (well it&rsquo;s also been over a year). In that time I&rsquo;ve ended up changing guilds twice and have progressed through all heroic content while it was current and am currently progressing in mythic Tomb. Specifically, we recently killed Mistress Sassz&rsquo;ine and are now on Maiden of Vigilance.
Now of the two I would definitely argue Mistress is the more interesting fight, with lots going all almost the whole time.</article>

          </div>
          <article class="post-content">Blizzard recently made some pretty big changes to how mythic+ works, both in the way of loot and how the keys themselves handle. The big points being:
 Beating the key quickly no longer rewards more loot, rather higher level keys (15+) have a chance at giving more loot. Completing the key in time also provides one extra piece of loot. Keys no longer get depleted, rather downgraded. If you don&rsquo;t complete the dungeon in time, you get a new random key one level lower.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So the prepatch arrived a few days ago and I have had some time to do raids and dungeons with the changed talents and spells. So far it has been rather excellent, which has been a slight surprise. So far the removal of Spirit has not been a bother, though admittedly the content has also been made easier so the true test will come with the Legion dungeons and raids. I actually think healing has been more enjoyable now, the flow with Holy Words and reducing their cooldown is quite satisfying though it can lead to moments of slight frustration when there has not been a sufficient need to use other healing spells and a burst of damage comes in.</article>

          <article class="post-content">It&rsquo;s been a while, and I&rsquo;ve been playing WoW again and actually had quite a bit of fun. I leveled a warrior because I felt like tanking a bit again and during that process ended up finding a guild which I&rsquo;ve been raiding with on my priest since (priest because there wasn&rsquo;t a need for tanks).
And it&rsquo;s all been quite excellent, the guild is fun, Hellfire Citadel has been fun to explore properly instead of in LFR.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So quite a bit has happened since my last post, most notably the closing of Nostalrius where I had played. Admittedly, I did not end up playing much more since my last post, primarily due to the concern of something like closing down happening. And while Nostalrius was well managed I do still have a preference to play on the official servers even though the game in some aspects feels inferior.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So I did end up freezing my subscription again and it&rsquo;ll run out on the 26th though I doubt I&rsquo;ll be logging in before that. In the end what solidified it for me was dabblinga bit with a private Vanilla server again and noticing how much more fun the game felt even with all its flaws. It&rsquo;s odd noticing how years of further development haven&rsquo;t really successfully added all that much that would motivate me to play and rather conversely succeeded in taking some of those motivating factors away.</article>

          <article class="post-content">Things have been rather slow lately. After BRF, I haven&rsquo;t really participated in raids which is a tad unfortunate. This is partially because as far as I can tell, there haven&rsquo;t really been further raids organised in the guild or they&rsquo;ve been unfortunately too late for my schedule.
However, I&rsquo;ve not been completely idle, there has been some running of LFR which has lead to somewhat upgraded rings on both the priest &amp; druid (still the 690 variant though).</article>

          <article class="post-content">Yesterday, some raiding did actually manage to happen, kind of. A Blackrock Foundry normal run was started, sadly only five people from the guild showed up. This time however, the raid leader decided to PUG the rest of the group so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a completely wasted effort and we (well, I) did get to experience the raid! Well, as said, kind of. While I stayed for the whole raid and we did clear all of it, at the end it was only me with one other guild member.</article>

No further raids have happened so far, though there is one scheduled for tonight though only with two people signed up. I&rsquo;ve made decent progress on the Talon Queen title, needing only ~3000 more reputation &amp; I&rsquo;ll be getting around 2000 from tomorrow&rsquo;s Heroic Skyreach. As the dungeon event is ending, I&rsquo;ll probably end up grinding the rest of the reputation out in the world as I haven&rsquo;t bothered putting together a group for the Mythic variant of Skyreach yet and probably won&rsquo;t end up doing that before the event is over.</article>

          <article class="post-content">The last couple of weeks have gone by rather quickly, it seems. Much of that time seems to have gone with WoW, which for the time being seems to have captured my interest again which has been rather fun. As noted previously, I had started leveling a druid and managed to get to 100 almost a week ago now, last Friday morning. Leveling was one hell of a ride, I chose to do it primarily through dungeons though that stopped once I reached WoD levels, partially due to the item level restrictions for entering dungeons and partially due to long queue times.</article>

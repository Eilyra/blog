          <article class="post-content">The couple first weeks of Antorus progression are now behind me and the raid still feels rather simple. The new mechanics introduced by the mythic difficulty so far have been trivial though to be fair we are not that far into the raid yet with only five bosses down.
There are some bosses I&rsquo;m still looking forward to though, namely Kin&rsquo;garoth, Varimathras and Circle of Shivarra. They all had potential on heroic already and will be interesting to see them with more proper damage and healing tuning.</article>

          <article class="post-content">Week one of Antorus has come and gone and with it the first impressions of the new raid. Only on heroic so far as mythic isn&rsquo;t out yet, but still.
So far the raid hasn&rsquo;t offered many real challenges, with probably the most noteworthy fight being the Coven of Shivarra. That boss fight has the potential for some really nasty overlaps on heroic causing problems and almost instant wipes. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing it on mythic.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So the last week or so has been rather annoying as I ended up leaving the guild I was in and have been looking for a new one. Sadly, the search has gone rather terribly so far, though I have a few leads still. I&rsquo;m really hoping one of those pans out, as it would be rather sad to miss out on the early progress in Antorus since that&rsquo;s usually the most fun time.</article>

          <article class="post-content">This post is acutally quite late as we already killed him on Wednesday, however I figured it was still worth making. So indeed, Kil&rsquo;jaeden finally down after some 300+ wipes and now we finally get a small breather before Antorus comes out. Well, kind of, since we are hopefully re-killing Kil&rsquo;jaeden before Antorus comes out to give the people that didn&rsquo;t have the chance to be there an opportunity to get the achievement.</article>

          <article class="post-content">Blizzcon came and went and with it the announcment of a new expansion for World of Warcraft, Battle for Azeroth. And again they are talking about focusing on the fight between the Horde and the Alliance, this time with actual new game mechanics to emphasize that fight, specifically Warfronts and Island Expeditions though the latter don&rsquo;t have quite as heavy an emphasis but still involve doing that exploration while fighting against a team from the opposite faction.</article>

          <article class="post-content">The last few weeks of raiding have been mostly filled with progress on Kil&rsquo;jaeden. And slowly I am getting slightly frustrated and strangely enough, bored, with this boss. The fight requires a decent amount of attention though not quite on the levels of Mistress or Maid however everything just happens over such a long span of time that actually getting to the part we&rsquo;re progressing on is gettign frustrating.
That all is slightly strange, because at the start when almost nothing was happening as we were progressing phase one, I was actually quite enjoying the boss.</article>

          <article class="post-content">On Monday we finally managed to down Avatar after surprisingly few tries. Believe I personally have around 230, which seems to be quite on the low end for that boss. In the end as noted, the boss is quite simple. Sure the DPS and HPS requirements are somewhat tough, and phase one as a healer especially. But in the end, somewhat like Maiden, the kill ended up coming as a surprise.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So we&rsquo;ve gotten a lot more progress made on Avatar thanks to extending the raid lock. Honestly I&rsquo;m not quite sure if it was the right move but I do want to kill Kil&rsquo;jaeden before Antorus comes out so in that sense I suppose it could be helpful. And in theory at least, we should have the gear to be able to kill both bosses so it should be fine from that perspective.</article>

          <article class="post-content">So we finally managed to kill the Maiden yesterday! It felt like it was a bit too long time coming, which made finally managing it feel rather nice. At the same time, the kill was also rather anticlimactic because of how the fight works. Since it&rsquo;s only the two phases rotating the whole time, there&rsquo;s no real escalation built into the fight, it only requires concentration and clean play the whole time.</article>

          <article class="post-content">With patch 7.3 Blizzard released a new dungeon that unlocked a couple weeks ago called Seat of the Triumvirate. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to spend too much time in there with it being so new, but have managed a couple of runs in there, one on tyrannical and fortified each. And while neither run went particularily well I have to say Blizzard has created a rather fun dungeon with the exception of a couple mechanics, specifically the third boss and the trash before the second one.</article>

Classes

  * Demon Hunters are starting at Level 98 right now.
  * Death Knights will continue to start at Level 55.
  * Demon Hunters will have a short transform, with inner demon visuals.
  * Only Demon Hunters will be able to use glaives.
  * Double jump won't be disabled anywhere.
  * Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.
  * Some specs will use a renamed resource, such as Insanity for Shadow Priest.
  * The sewer class hall for Rogues looks great, not really like a sewer at all. It will have treasure chests.
  * No big update is planned for the Moonkin model, maybe some small tweaks.
  * No new major glyphs will be added.
  * No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.

Professions

  * There will be a "single system" to upgrade profession items. The current item will be destroyed, giving you a reagent needed for the upgrade.
  * A new team will be working on professions this time, including profession quest lines.
  * Professions will get some crafting items from dungeon loot.
  * Professions won't have daily cooldowns.

Transmog / Items / Stats

  * If the new transmog system is account wide, the item must be usable by the class trying to use it.
  * No tabard tab is currently planned, but the new transmog system should help to clear up some space.
  * Multistrike is being removed and other secondary stats will have changes as well.
  * Players can still only equip three profession crafted items.
  * There won't be specific item art for each race and class, as Artifact weapon art is the priority.

Misc

  * Dungeons will absolutely be relevant again.
  * Illidan is ready to lead Demon Hunters against the Burning Legion.
  * The Park in Stormwind won't be repaired yet.
  * There are plans for Jaina.
  * The backpack might be updated.
  * Warlords was not a filler expansion and built some things that will be used going forward.

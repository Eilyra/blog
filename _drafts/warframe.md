title: Warframe???

I'm starting to come to the conclusion that Warframe is a pretty nice game.

In case you're unfamiliar with Warframe, it's a third-person shooter in which you play a Tenno; a being capable of controlling mechanical constructs known as Warframes. The warframes essentially work as classes as they all possess four different abilities which they can use in combat. You're free to switch out your warframe at any time between missions though, in this they work the same as the rest of your equipment.

Your warframe, like your weapons, level up as you play allowing you to upgrade them with increasingly powerful mods. These mods are the core of the progression system of the game, as they are the primary means of increasing your power. Sure, you do gain some health, shields and power as you level up your warframe but most of it comes from the mods. The mods also do things like increase the damage you deal as well as the efficiency or power of your abilities.

title: Warframe???

I'm starting to come to the conclusion that Warframe is a pretty nice game.

In case you're unfamiliar with Warframe, it's a third-person shooter in which you play a Tenno; a being capable of controlling mechanical constructs known as Warframes. The warframes essentially work as classes as they all possess four different abilities which they can use in combat. Interestingly however, the warframes are just a piece of equipment just like your weapons. This allows you to do quite significant switches in playstyle simply by equipping a different warframe.

Well darn it, the defaults look pretty decent. Don't want to go with those though, just on principle <.<

As luck would have it, development has progressed! We are now not using defaults, even if we are somewhat close-ish. Things should be moderately settled down at the moment, so that's good!


### Have some code

{% highlight py %}
var hello = "world"
print hello

for i in range(0,10):
	print i
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  puts "Outputting a very lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong line"
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

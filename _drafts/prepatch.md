title: Prepatch stuff, how raiding feels, etc.

Condensed thoughts:

* Healing feels different but still fun, got the hang of it (I think) pretty quickly (use Holy Words *a lot*, highly mana efficient)
* Holy Words are pretty fun so far
  - Especially the "big heal" one, though it could heal for a tad more as it isn't even half of my health (150k of 400k, so not that impressive when a tank has 800k health...)
* Mana hasn't been a problem (yet)
* Kinda odd being without Lightwell, though no great loss
* Odder being without Mindbender, though not needed as of yet
* Instant FH procs are kinda fun, so there's that
* Further thoughts after tomorrow's raid I guess, might be enough to finalize this with that info? Otherwise, wait until ~monday?

title: WIP WoW, Raiding, etc.?

Once more, a bunch of stuff has happened since last time. Interestingly, it has actually been quite positive.

Now the primary thing has been me resubscribing to WoW, ended up leveling a warrior a bit which ended when I wound up finding a guild that didn not need tanks but did need a healer. Consequently, I started playing my priest again and it's been great fun. Been doing some raiding again, and our first "proper" heroic HFC run ended up going really well, we got all the way to Mannoroth with only Tyrant Velhari and Archimonde left standing at the end of the week.

It has also lead to a quite large shift in my enjoyment of the game which has been good news. I am enjoying healing a great deal again and actually properly starting to look forward to Legion and progressing with the guild once it hits. I am also quite a lot less apprehensive about the upcoming changes, though I know I will end up missing Spirit as a stat I've ended up quite interested seeing how it will turn out.

I have also thoroughly ended up enjoying Hellfire Citadel, odd as that may sound. I enjoy most of the bossfights and while the atmosphere can get a bit samey with all the Fel going around especially considering that will be a central theme in the next expansion as well, I have still enjoyed my time in there. Though whether that is more a consequence of the people I have ended up playing with or the design of the place is hard to pinpoint at this time.

So hopefully the guild survives the transition into Legion and there is a great deal more of raiding to be had in the future!

So I've gotten somewhat hooked on running mythic+. It's quite a bit of fun when one finds a decent group to run with and provides a pretty consistent level of challenge and best of all, it's not something you get locked out of as long as you can find a new keystone. Though to be fair, the different affixes do affect the challenge in hugely different ways as well as putting demands on different parts of the group. Necrotic for example is hugely dependant on how well the tank performs while volcanic while simple, requires the whole group to stay alert.

I sadly haven't managed anything higher than a +11 on time, was 27 seconds overtime on a +12 last reset with teeming, necrotic and tyrannical which I though was a pretty decent performance still. It was actually a pretty fun reset this last one,
